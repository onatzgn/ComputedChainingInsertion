# ComputedChainingInsertion
The task is to write member functions of a class that stores numbers using Computed Chaining Insertion.

I only implemented the isThisYourHome, insert, and find_num_of_probes functions in ComputedChaining.cpp. I did not make any other changes in the code. I manually entered the insert part in the main code step by step just to see each detail.
